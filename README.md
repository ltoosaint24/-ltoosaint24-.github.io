<p>Problem Statement:
The data observation will be primarily based on the observation of the effects of pollutant emissions effect on population activity. The data will be statistically analyzed to decipher if there any direct relations to the pollutants to human productions, outcomes, and other technical activities. 

Hypothesis:
H0: Based on the comparison of number of deaths due to pollution within regions and number of emissions, it can inferred that areas of high rate of pollutions will also experience high fatality rates.

H1: There may not be any significant direct correlations to pollution and deaths, because the various method of maintenance, and health procedures that secure the viability of a region.
