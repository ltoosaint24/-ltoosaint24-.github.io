<p><a href = "index.html"> <h2>Professional Portfolio:</h3> </p></a>
<p>I would like to casually introduce myself within the GitHub data platform. The current portfolio would an initial documentation piece of my current data activities. Click on the link to view the full profile. </p>
<p><h2>Collab Notebook</h2></p>
<p>Problem Statement:</p>
  
<p><a href = "Pollution_Emmission_Effects_on_Population_ActivityDSPT9.ipynb"><h3>Effects on Pollutants on Human Activity</h3></a></p>
<p>The data observation will be primarily based on the observation of the effects of pollutant emissions effect on population activity. The data will be statistically analyzed to decipher if there any direct relations to the pollutants to human productions, outcomes, and other technical activities. 

Hypothesis:
H0: Based on the comparison of number of deaths due to pollution within regions and number of emissions, it can inferred that areas of high rate of pollutions will also experience high fatality rates.

H1: There may not be any significant direct correlations to pollution and deaths, because the various method of maintenance, and health procedures that secure the viability of a region.</p>
<p><h3>Summary:</h3></p>
<p> This Notebook consist of the analysis of statistical mean values and charts that pertains to the ratio of pollutants that are found within various regions. There are data charts regarding the quantity of Sulphur dioxides, Nitrogen oxides, and Non-methane pollutants.

<p> Alongside of the data analysis notebook. There is an active discussion of the elements being observed and the statistical values that are derived from the data platform being studied. </p>
