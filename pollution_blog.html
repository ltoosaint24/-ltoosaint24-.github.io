     <p>The Earth is consistently evolving. There have been many centuries of industrial development that has lead to various harsh distributions of debris, and pollutant emissions within the atmosphere. 
     The rate of human production has superseded the natural Earth's ability to filter, and maintain optimal status.
     For example, there are several health circumstances that are being taken place that can potentially be caused by high concentration of pollutants that are being discovered 
     in various areas. Although, these molecular constituents are necessary for both natural and industrial development, the aggregation of such bi-products could results to
     negative side-effects. For instance, the surplus of salt contents, such as Sulphur Dioxide, or Nitrogen oxides could lead to severe weather patterns, or contribute to 
     various health defects, such as lung disease.</p>
    <p>Our current study has been regarding analyzing data sets that pertains to recording the number of pollutants that are found within differentiated regions.
    The were also, data frames that concentrated on monitoring population growth activities, such as death rates due to pollution, and education rates. 
    The data sets that are being analyze are pertinent to understanding the connections within various test statistics, and data correlations. 
    During our analysis, a null hypothesis revolved determining the relationship status of pollutants and human activity. 
    The datasets that were utilized were joined and act as comparable of the essential activities that often correlate to the independent variables.</p> 
    <p>However, our data analysis starts with the thorough review of the type of pollutants that can be found within our atmosphere. 
      By definition, pollutants are considered to be any type of concentration of contamination found within essential resources, like air and water.
      The aggregation of these pollutants can lead to defects within both the environment, and it's habitants. They can also become determinants of area survival, along with progress. Pollutants are detrimental to the consistency of the molecular concentration.
      Extreme oscillation of molecules within our environment often leads to mutations that inevitably cause medical defects within the health of all habitants in the environment. 
      The following pictogram introduces the four pollutants that will be discuss during this research study:</p><figure><img src = "Pollutants.png" width = 380 height = 400  ></img>
    <figcaption>There millions of particles of Nitrogen dioxides, Sulphur dioxide, volatile organic compounds being emitted into the atmosphere daily, especially within high industrial regions.
    The gas emission from steam boats, vehicles exhaust, agriculture, and factories contributes to over 90% of the pollutants that are found within our atmosphere.</figcaption</figure> </tr>
